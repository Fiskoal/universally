# UniversAlly

Here at UniversAlly, we take pride in the galactic opportunities we provide to our customers! Anything from moons to planets to stars, this is the one-stop-shop for all celestial bodies! *(Currently limited to the Milky Way)*

[Deployed Application](https://universally.herokuapp.com).

*Point-of-sale app made as a demonstration for Ally.*

## MVP

- Inventory Page
  - Display pricing
  - Allow users to add items to the cart
- Cart
  - Display total price of items in cart
  - Allow users to remove items from cart

## Potential (Optional) Functionality

These are features that are not required for MVP, but would be nice to implement.

- More shopping!
  - Add more celestial bodies, potentially with an API from NASA or something
  - Filters for inventory page
- Login/Signup *(Would require setting up a database)*
  - Create, save, and share wishlists
  - Add favorite items
  - Order history
- Checkout
  - This would be a mock checkout, most likely making use of the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/)
