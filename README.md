[Deployed Application (Not yet live)](https://google.com).

*Point-of-sale app made as a demonstration for Ally.*

## MVP

- Inventory Page
  - Display pricing
  - Allow users to add items to the cart
- Cart
  - Display total price of items in cart
  - Allow users to remove items from cart

## Potential (Optional) Functionality

These are features that are not required for MVP, but would be nice to implement.

- Login/Signup *(Would require setting up a database)*
  - Create, save, and share wishlists
  - Add favorite items
  - Order history
- Checkout
  - This would be a mock checkout, most likely making use of the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/)
